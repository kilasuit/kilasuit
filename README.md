### Hi there 👋

kilasuit is my username of choice as I really enjoyed playing Hitman and he's a `killer in a suit` & there's nothing more to it than that. Also it is my Gamertag on Xbox & most places where I can get hold of it unless I use one of my many other handles.

I've got lots in mind that I want to achieve, and like us all, I definitely do not have enough time to complete all the things I'd like to, at least not on my own. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on many different PowerShell things where I help out where possible as Working Group Member for Cmdlets, Engine and Interactive UX. I’ve previously spent time around PowerShell, DSC & DSCCommunity.
- 📄 I'm currently documenting different [DocTypes](https://github.com/kilasuit/doctypes)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/They/Them
- ⚡ Fun fact 1: I blog and talk about #MentalHealth on a number of different mediums including over on [Mental Health Affects Someone Like Me](https://mhasl.me)
- ⚡ Fun fact 2: Former 7 time Microsoft MVP in Cloud & Datacenter Management.
- 🛠 I am revisting the world of Web Development with multiple different sites.
